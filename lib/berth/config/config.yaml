# First I put my config.yml file within the /config/ directory within my #  Rails application. It looks something like this:

:development: &development_settings
  :agency:
    :name: "Almar Services"
    :phone: "699842"
    :fax: "719755"	
    :email: "operations@almarservices.com"

:production:
  <<: *development_settings
