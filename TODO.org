* issue with rake results in parsing and appearing new .quest.yml

* location issue in lib/berth/parser:55
it is not "cpc" or "taman" but a string containing path "spec/bin/parse_cpc_spec.rb"
need to change it to f.e "cpc" to run tests and back? for gem to work

    def quest_hash_pairs
      p location
      YAML::load_file("#{lib_dir}/yamls/#{location}.yml").to_hash
     YAML::load_file("#{lib_dir}/yamls/cpc.yml").to_hash
    end

* create Berth class as in Ruby/pda

    include new parce.rb from watir 
    add rmp.rb and portcall.rb
    refactor rmp.rb and portcall.rb
