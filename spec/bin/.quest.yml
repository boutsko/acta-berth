AFTER THAT AN HOURLY RATE DEPENDING ON A NUMBER AND POWER OF TUGS USED IS APPLIED, MAKING ADDITIONAL COSTS PRACTICALLY UNPREDICTABLE IN ADVANCE. THEREFORE, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR CAPTAINS TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE TUGS ARE NOT USED FOR LONGER THAN 3 HOURS PER OPERATION (BERTHING OR UNBERTHING) AND THAT PRECISE TIMES TUGS WERE BEING USED ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED IN TUG'S BILLS. MASTER IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT ON TUG'S, FIRE TUG'S, PILOT'S AND WATCHMAN'S BILLS SHIP'S STAMP IS VERY CLEAR AND READABLE TO AVOID INVOICING COMPLICATIONS AFTER DEPARTURE. MASTER IS TO SEND THE FOLL INFO ASAP IN ORDER TO PASS IT TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES AT LEAST 48 HOURS BEFORE ARRIVAL:
